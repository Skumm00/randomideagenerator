This is a program in python in which you can use it by simply running the program. To open it, just clone or download the repo, open it in your proferred code editor(I reccemond VS Code) and then just run main.py. The libraries used were import random, os and datetime and was quite a challenge to incorprate. The program it self can give you a random idea or thing for you to do, if you're stuck and need help and there are various topics and difficulties you can choose from for the ideas. The inspiration for this project actually came from HackClub itself!
